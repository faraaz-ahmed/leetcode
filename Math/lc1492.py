'''1492. The kth Factor of nSolvedMediumTopicsCompaniesHintYou are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.Example 1:Input: n = 12, k = 3Output: 3Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.Example 2:Input: n = 7, k = 2Output: 7Explanation: Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.Example 3:Input: n = 4, k = 4Output: -1Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.Constraints:1 <= k <= n <= 1000Follow up:Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?'''import mathclass Solution:    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:        factors_a, factors_b = [], []        for i in range(1, math.floor(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):            if n % i == 0:                factors_a.append(i)                complement_factor = n // i                if (complement_factor != i):                    factors_b.append(complement_factor)            if k == len(factors_a):                return factors_a[len(factors_a) - 1]        k -= len(factors_a)        if k <= len(factors_b):            return factors_b[len(factors_b) - k]        return -1
